# Orion
A Terminal-Based Money Management Application

Project Idea:
Orion is a terminal-based Application in C that prompts users for their current expenses and helps them manage their monthly expenses. Based on the input data, it will provide personalized suggestions to reduce or increase their expenses. It allows users to create personal accounts, enter and sort expenses by priority. It utilizes basic concepts of C, like file handling, file interlinking, loops, sorting, and conditionals to achieve its goals of budget allocation and to minimize overspending. It generates personalized suggestions using AI, which was obtained by triggering the Google Gemini API through Python and executing it in C using a bash file. Orionâ€™s three key features include user authentication, priority-based sorting, and Python AI suggestion Integration
